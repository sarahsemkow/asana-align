# Asana Align #
Asana Align is a Yoga AI Coach which classifies yoga poses created for a group project in my AI/ML course. Since then, I have augmented the yoga pose classifier by training a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which can classify the given yoga pose.

## Steps we took ##
- Gathered images of the 5 most popular yoga poses from Kaggle
- Preprocessed all the images to follow the expected format (RGB only) for training purposes
- Developed and trained a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) model to classify the given yoga pose
- Computed angles for specific body parts to provide feedback (TBA)
- Deployed the model onto a Jetson Nano
